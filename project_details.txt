Custom Invitations as Word Documents
Say you have a text file of guest names. This guests.txt file 
has one name per line, as follows:
Prof. Plum
Miss Scarlet
Col. Mustard
Al Sweigart
RoboCop

Write a program that would generate a Word document with custom invitations that look 
like Figure 15-11.

Since Python-Docx can use only those styles that already exist in the Word document, 
you will have to first add these styles to a blank Word file and then open that file 
with Python-Docx. There should be one invitation per page in the resulting Word document, 
so call add_break() to add a page break after the last paragraph of each invitation. 
This way, you will need to open only one Word document to print all of the invitations 
at once.

You can download a sample guests.txt file from https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2/.

List of style names I used for reference:
(all centered with 1.5 line spacing)
* lines135 — 23 pt BrushScript MT italic
* guest — 36 pt Orbitron bold
* date — 23 pt Oswald regular
